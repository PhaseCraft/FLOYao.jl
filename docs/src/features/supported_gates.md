| `XGate`                            | Together with `Y` the only gate that does not preserve fermionic parity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `YGate`                            | See above                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `ZGate`                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `RotationGate{⋯,⋯,ZGate}`          | The only single qubit rotation gate since $R_x(θ)γ_i R_x(-θ)$ is not a linear combination of Majorana operators for all Majorana operators. Similar for $R_y$                                                                                                                                                    |
| `PauliKronBlock`                   | A kronecker product of Pauli operators s.t. that first and last operator are either $X$ or $Y$ and all operators in between are $Z$.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `RotationGate{⋯,⋯,PauliKronBlock}` | A rotation gate with generator as in the last line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `KronBlock{⋯,⋯,RotationGate{⋯}}`   | Kronecker products of supported Rotation gates (i.e. those that are generated by supported `PauliKronBlock`s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `TimeEvolution`                    | Time evolution with FLO hamiltonians, i.e. sums of `PauliKronBlock`s                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `AbstractMatrix`                   | Unless the gate type is already explicitely implemented or know to not be a FLO gate, `FLOYao` will try to automatically convert the gate matrix in the qubit basis to a matrix in the Majorana basis. But note that this is fairly slow (although still poly-time instead of exp-time)                                                                                                                                                        |
